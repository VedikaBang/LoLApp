**LoLApp** - Real-Time Threat Intelligence for Living off The Land Attacks at Application level.  
             This project is inspired by [LOLBAS][https://lolbas-project.github.io/] and [GTFOBins][https://gtfobins.github.io/]

             LoLApp is not a directory of exploits or vulnerabilities. Instead, it provides a nuanced understanding of how everyday applications can be co-opted for nefarious purposes. Itâ€™s a testament to the creativity of attackers and a call to arms for defenders to think outside the box. 
             
             The project emphasizes applications that have been previously leveraged in real-world attacks, ensuring relevance and practicality for effective log analysis [Please find report here]
