## App Artifacts
| IoC | Observations | DFIR Relevance |
|:----|:-------------|:---------------|
| `C:\Program Files\Atera Networks\AteraAgent\` | Default installation directory | Presence of Atera Agent indicates remote management capability. Could be exploited for unauthorized access or persistence. |
| `AteraAgent.exe` in `C:\Program Files\Atera Networks\AteraAgent\` | Main executable file | Execution patterns of `AteraAgent.exe` can indicate abnormal or unauthorized remote management activities. |
| `%AppData%\Atera Networks\AteraAgent\` | Configuration and log files | Configurations and logs stored here can reveal operational patterns and potentially unauthorized or malicious modifications. |
| `AteraAgentService.log` in `C:\Program Files\Atera Networks\AteraAgent\` | Log file for the Atera Agent Service | Logs service activities, errors, and network connections, essential for investigating remote operations and diagnostics. |
| Registry Key: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Atera Networks\` | Registry entries for configurations | Modifications in this registry path may suggest configuration changes for persistence or unauthorized access. |
| Network traffic to `*.atera.com` | Atera server communications | Unusual traffic patterns to Atera domains could indicate misuse for command and control or data exfiltration activities. |
| File Transfer Directories: | | |
| `C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\Atera\` | Download location for Atera files | Files downloaded via Atera might be located here; could indicate data exfiltration or tool transfer. |
| `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Atera\` | Default directory for file transfers | Unusual files or modifications in this directory might suggest unauthorized data movement. |
| Amcache and Shellbags | | |
| `Amcache.hve` entries related to Atera | Records execution of Atera-related executables | Can provide historical execution details even after file deletion, indicating Atera usage or abuse. |
